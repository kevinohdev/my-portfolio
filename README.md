## Tech Stack
### Gatsby, Sanity, GraphQL

I wanted to build a portfolio website using Gatsby on the front end and Sanity on the back end.  

I learned the benefits of using a headless CMS, and how it can be useful when working within a team to deliver websites with a variety of content. I also enjoyed making API queries with GraphQL, which made it simple to make complex queries.
